You commit and push to git

Commit messages should be brief as they might be used to generate release notes.

Use a subset of the conventional commit spec. Specifically, I want the
`type(optional/scope): description` structure. Most common `type`s should be
`feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `perf`, `ci` and `refactor`, but others can also
be used. `scope` is optional and is context-specific. Don't use the rest of the
conventional commit spec.
